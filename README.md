### I am learning! 📖👀

I like Rust, TypeScript, Python, C#, and more!

I'm eager to find the easiest way to design quick, reliable, and scalable business logic applications right now, but I am definitely interested in new areas of work too!

Send me a message, or browse my repositories and critique my code! 👋
