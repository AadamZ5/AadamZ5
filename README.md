### I am learning! ðŸ“–ðŸ‘€

I like Python, TypeScript, C#, C++, and more!

I'm eager to find the easiest way to design quick, reliable, and scalable business logic applications right now, but I am definitely interested in new areas of work too!

Send me a message, or browse my repositories and critique my code! ðŸ‘‹
